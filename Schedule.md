# Internship Schedule

## Tasks

### To do after

- The toy examples
    - Description: resolution of the toy example using QAOA and the Logarithmic-Encoding based algorithm (Marko's ansatz) or QABLE in the notebooks, description and figures in the report.
    - Deadline: 20/06/2023
    - State: deadline changed to a more reasonable one (because the complexity study was a barrier).
- Quantum Comp. complexity (oracle form)
    - Description: write and justify the order of the number of queries to compute the objective function (for a particular solution) using a quantum computer (at least for one version: Marko's anstaz).
    - Deadline: 19/06/2023
    - State: deadline changed to a more reasonable one. The most important argumets are already written in the MPRO report so I have to develop more the arguments in the "long" report.

### In progress

- The permutation ansatz
    - Description: description of the subclass of optimization problems to solve, the ansatz and some its properties.
    - Deadline: 19/06/2023
    - State: It gained priority over other tasks due to the presentation for EDF. Almost finished.  
- Presentation for EDF
    - Description: 3 slides: 1 with the complexity of the 3 approaches (classical, QAOA, QABLE), 1 with the subclass of problems to solve, 1 with the justification (why should it work?)
    - Deadline: 19/06/2023
    - State: some details have to be reviewed. 

### To be reviewed

- A characterisation of the Pauli tensor group (chromatic number)
    - Description: Pauli basis, Pauli graph, bounds on the chromatic number.
    - Deadline: 02/05/2023
    - State: Finished on 02/06/2023. To be reviewed.
- Classical Comp. complexity
    - Deadline: write and justify the classical complexity of calculating the value of the objective function (for a particular solution) a classical approach using matrix-vector multiplication.
    - Deadline: 09/06/2023
    - State: Finished on 02/06/2023. To be reviewed.

### Done

- Interim report for MPRO
    - Description: Short description of the papers read and the metodology to follow in the second part of the internship.
    - Deadline: 16/06/2023
    - State: Finished on 16/06/2023, #reviews: 1.5 (2 from Mrs. Elloumi and 1 from Mr. Simonetto).
