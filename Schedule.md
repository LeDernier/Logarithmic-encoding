# Internship Schedule

## Tasks

### To do
- A characterisation of the Pauli tensor group (chromatic number)
    - Description: Pauli basis, Pauli graph, bounds on the chromatic number.
    - Deadline: 31/06/2023
- The toy examples
    - Description: resolution of the toy example using QAOA and the Logarithmic-Encoding based algorithm (Marko's ansatz) or QABLE in the notebooks, description and figures in the report.
    - Deadline: 02/06/2023
- Classical Comp. complexity
    - Deadline: write and justify the classical complexity of calculating the value of the objective function (for a particular solution) a classical approach using matrix-vector multiplication.
    - Deadline: 05/06/2023
- Quantum Comp. complexity (oracle form)
    - Description: write and justify the order of the number of queries to compute the objective function (for a particular solution) using a quantum computer (at least for one version: Marko's anstaz).
    - Deadline: 06/06/2023
- The permutation ansatz
    - Description: description of the subclass of optimization problems to solve, the ansatz and some its properties.
    - Deadline: 08/06/2023
- Presentation for EDF
    - Description: 3 slides: 1 with the complexity of the 3 approaches (classical, QAOA, QABLE), 1 with the subclass of problems to solve, 1 with the justification (why should it work?)
    - Deadline: 09/06/2023

    
- Interim report for MPRO [Deadline: ]
